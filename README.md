# Project Overview
An Email Spam Classifier that uses machine learning techniques to identify and classify emails as spam or not spam. This project demonstrates the application of natural language processing (NLP) for text classification tasks.

# Objective
To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting spam emails by analyzing their textual content and features.

# Today's Work
Performed data preprocessing to clean and prepare email data.
Extracted features using techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
Trained the classification model using algorithms like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Saved the trained model for deployment or further testing.
# Requirements
Python 3.x: Programming language used for implementation.
# Libraries:
NumPy - For numerical computations.
Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn - For machine learning model development.
NLTK - For natural language processing tasks.
Dataset: A labeled email dataset containing spam and non-spam examples (e.g., the "SMS Spam Collection" or similar).
